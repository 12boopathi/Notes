# Notes
Daily update about classes
RAM -> primary storage memory, two types of Ram S RAM(Static Ram) and D RAM(Dynamic RAM), both S Ram and D Ram are volatile memory, S Ram is made up of capacitors,S Ram is faster than D Ram, CPU knows only addition.
Microprocessor -> it contains only the processor.
microcontroller -> it contais the complete computer system (CpU, I/O, RAM, ROM etc..)
median is the bus.
GPIO -> General Purpose Input/Output
PHERIPHERALS -> GPIO -> to communicate the outside environment, Pheeripherals are send by SYSTEM BUS.
APB2 speed is twice to APB1
